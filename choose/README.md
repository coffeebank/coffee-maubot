None


## Usage

List out choices, separated with a `|` character.


## Notes

- This bot intentionally exposes the user requesting a `choose`, in order to reduce abuse. 
- Directly returning user input is always risky. Use this bot with caution. `choose` is not responsible for any damages that may occur.
